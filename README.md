The Capsistant is an intelligent hat that tells visually-impaired users what they are looking at.

Background: At Google, our goal is to make information universally accessible for all. With the Capsistant, we are empowering               New Yorkers with visual impairements to experience the world in front of them.
            The Capsistant runs on a Raspberry Pi 3, which relies on the Google Assistant Python SDK to label objects using the             Google Cloud Vision API
